//Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. 
//A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

//Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.

//The name of the java file must match the class name. 
//When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.

//Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen

//Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

//When you are working with text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".
//The Print() Method-There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().

//The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output

//System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". 
//The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).
//You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).


/*Print Numbers
You can also use the println() method to print numbers.

However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes
*/



/*Java Comments
Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code*/

//Single-line Comments
//Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
//Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

/*Java Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */..
//Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java


/*Java Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false/*
