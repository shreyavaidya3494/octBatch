<!-- z-index -The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.

An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).

Note: If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code will be shown on top. 
z-index is 1 then that block will be ahead. If z index is -1 then that block will be backward-->

<div class="zindex1">
    This is box1 with bcolor as blue
</div>

<div class="zindex2">
    This is box2 with bcolor as pink
