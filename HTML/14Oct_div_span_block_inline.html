<!-- Tag should always be opened and closed else it will misbehave -->

<h1> 1....Example1 using only opening h1 tag not closing
    <p>Let us see p tag is opened and closed</p>
    <div>div tab is opened and closed
        end......1

    <h1> 2.....Example2 using both opening h1 tag and closing after p tag closure

<div> 3 .....Trying to use htag and ptag in divtag 
    <h1>This is htag</h1>
    <p>This is ptag</p>

<!-- What if we do not use div tag in above example? Then for applying CSS, I will have to do separately for p tag line & h1 tag line. Through div I can group and apply CSS together -->

<!-- Right click and format selection to give proper indentation -->
    
<!-- Ideally in a website you should be able to scroll vertically but horizontal scrolling will not look good. Use div tag accordingly -->

<!-- We have inline tag and block level tag -->
<!-- Block level elements occupy full width of UI and get started with fresh line. Like I go alone for movie and book entire row. Example:-div, pre,p, h tag -->
<!-- Inline elements occupy only that much width of UI uptill where content is writtenn. Example:-Span -->

<div>Checking inline and block elements
    This is written in divv
    Hello divv end
</div>

<p>P tag started
    ....
    ptag end

<h1>h tag started
    &&&&&
    h tag ended

<!-- Right Click on UI screen and inspect and hover mouse to see right end closing of screenn -->

<!-- Block level element:
1. Always starts with fresh line
2. By default takes as much as width of UI
3. Creates default margin on left and righ side of element.
4. Example-div, p, h tag etc

Inline element:
1. They never start on new line
2. They occupy length as much as necessary.
3. Do not create margin
4. Example- span,button, lable, input tags etc -->
